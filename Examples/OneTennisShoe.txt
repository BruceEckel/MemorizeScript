One Tennis Shoe
by Shel Silverstein

HARVEY. This is not going to be easy to say.
SYLVIA. Try.
HARVEY. It's not an easy subject to discuss -
SYLVIA. What is it?
HARVEY. Well okay - okay.
WAITER. Can I get you anything else?
HARVEY. No. No thank you.
WAITER. Very good.
SYLVIA. What? What? Are you sick? Are you - ?
HARVEY. I'm fine -
SYLVIA. You're having an affair - you're in love with somebody else -
HARVEY. No, I'm fine - I love you -
SYLVIA. Well, then what?
HARVEY. I can't - say it -
SYLVIA. Then don't say it - I want another espresso -
HARVEY. I've got to say it - I'm going to say it - you - are - becoming - a -
SYLVIA. Yes - yes - what - ? I'm becoming a what? I'm becoming a nag? I'm becoming a bore? What?
HARVEY. Worse.
SYLVIA. Nothing is worse than a bore. Harvey - what? What am I becoming?
HARVEY. You - are becoming a - you are turning into a - a - bag lady.
SYLVIA. A bag lady -
HARVEY. Yes. That's the hardest thing I'll ever have to say.
SYLVIA. I'm turning into a bag lady.
HARVEY. Yes, I'm afraid you are.
SYLVIA. I assume you mean one of those crazy old raggy ladies who pick things out of garbage cans and carry all their clothes in shopping bags and have lice in their hair and talk to themselves - I assume we're talking about the same ladies.
HARVEY. I didn't say you had lice in your hair.
SYLVIA. But you did say I was a bag lady.
HARVEY. I said turning into - not was -
SYLVIA. Turning into a bag lady - well, that's pretty much like turning into a werewolf, isn't it?
HARVEY. Please - I'm just trying to -
SYLVIA. You are trying to tell me I'm a bag lady.
HARVEY. It's been evident for some time - you've been showing signs for quite some time.
SYLVIA. Signs -
HARVEY. Indications - symptoms - manifestations -
SYLVIA. Of becoming a bag lady.
HARVEY. Yes.
SYLVIA. There's no chance that you could be mistaken - you're sure.
HARVEY. I wish I was mistaken - I want to be wrong.
SYLVIA. Well, I think I'd like a second opinion.
HARVEY. I'm serious about this.
SYLVIA. Harvey - look at me. Tell me - look at me, Harvey - wouldn't you say I was a little too young to be a bag lady? Maybe a little too old to be queen of the prom - but just a teensy weensy too young to be an old bag lady?
HARVEY. You think old bag ladies started out as old bag ladies? They started out as young women and then -
SYLVIA. And then they went to a wild party and somebody slipped them a shopping bag and it was all over.
HARVEY. I'm trying to make you understand -
SYLVIA. That I am a bag lady - because I am carrying a singular shopping bag - a Bloomingdale's shopping bag - that makes me - a bag lady - oh - Harvey - you are such a schmuck.
HARVEY: It's not because of carrying a shopping bag - it is because of what's in the bag -
SYLVIA. Because of what's in the bag?
HARVEY. Yes.
SYLVIA. Well I'm sorry if the contents of my bag don't meet your standards - from now on I'll try to carry only Gucci shoes and Pierre Cardin -
HARVEY. I'm not talking about -
SYLVIA. You're telling me what to carry in my bag.
HARVEY. I'm telling you what not to carry.
SYLVIA. What not to carry - what should I not carry, Harvey? What should I not carry so that you will not think I am a bag lady? Tell me and I'll stop carrying it - tell me - tell me -
HARVEY. A sweater.
SYLVIA. A sweater.
HARVEY. And a plastic raincoat.
SYLVIA. A sweater and a raincoat make me a bag lady.
HARVEY. And a tennis shoe.
SYLVIA. Raincoat, sweater and tennis shoes make me a -
HARVEY. Tennis shoe - shoe singular - one shoe.
SYLVIA. One shoe makes me a bag lady.
HARVEY. Why are you carrying one tennis shoe?
SYLVIA. I'm taking it down to the Bowery - to meet my wino lover - my one-legged wino lover - on Avenue B.
HARVEY. May I inquire about the picture frame?
SYLVIA. What about it?
HARVEY. A picture frame - you tell me about it.
SYLVIA. It's a picture frame - beveled wood - probably pine - approximately nine by twelve with a wire -
HARVEY. Why the picture frame?
SYLVIA. Why indeed - how about - to hang a picture with? How about that?
HARVEY. Why did you pick it up - out of the garbage can? That's what I -
SYLVIA. Not out of the garbage - it was next to the can - leaning against the can - not touching the garbage.
HARVEY. Why did you pick it up from next to the can?
SYLVIA. Well, how can I hang a picture in it if I didn't pick it up?
HARVEY. Why didn't you buy a frame?
SYLVIA. Why buy a frame when this is a perfectly good frame?
HARVEY. That somebody threw away.
SYLVIA. Yes, that somebody threw away -
HARVEY. And the couch cushion -
SYLVIA. It's a perfectly good cushion - I can use it on my desk chair.
HARVEY. So you just took it.
SYLVIA. When this cushion is covered in a blue floral pattern it will be so -
HARVEY. And the magazines - all the magazines -
SYLVIA. Why are you attacking me like this? What's really bothering you?
HARVEY. This - this is what's really bothering me - what could bother a man more than seeing his wife collecting picture frames and tennis shoes and -
SYLVIA. Well, don't forget the grapes while you're at it.
HARVEY. You have grapes in there?
SYLVIA. I have everything in here - I'm a bag lady, aren't I?
HARVEY. You are a bag lady - you say you have grapes and tennis shoes in there like it's perfectly normal - it is not normal - you are a bag lady.
SYLVIA. A moment ago I was becoming a bag lady - now I am a bag lady.
HARVEY. A moment ago I didn't know about the grapes.
SYLVIA. The grapes make me a bag lady.
HARVEY. The grapes and the raincoat and the tennis shoe -
SYLVIA. Stop harping on the tennis shoe - if the tennis shoe offends you I'll get rid of it - There - all right?
HARVEY. And the rest of the stuff.
SYLVIA. You want me to throw it all away? I will - I can just leave the bag here and walk away.
HARVEY. I just want you to -
SYLVIA. Except for the picture frame -
HARVEY. That's what I -
SYLVIA. We can leave the rest right here -
HARVEY. Sylvia, do you not see what is happening to you?
SYLVIA. What is happening to me is you - you're attacking me -
HARVEY. I'm trying to reach you - I'm trying to make you see what you're doing.
SYLVIA. I'm not doing anything. I just found a nice little picture frame and you turn it into a -
HARVEY. We can stop this now - if we're aware of it we can nip it in the bud -
SYLVIA. I don't see what needs nipping - what? What am I doing?
HARVEY. Will you do me a favor? One favor.
SYLVIA. What is it?
HARVEY. Open your purse.
SYLVIA. Why?
HARVEY. As a favor to me - as a whim.
SYLVIA. Why should I cater to your whims?
HARVEY. Will you open your purse?
SYLVIA. You think there's another tennis shoe in my purse?
HARVEY. Will you - open your purse? Will you open your purse?
SYLVIA. No.
HARVEY. Will you allow me -
SYLVIA. A woman's bag - purse - is a personal thing -
HARVEY. I'm going to open this purse - (She releases it.)
SYLVIA. You will not find another tennis shoe.
HARVEY. (Opens purse - looks away - then looks at her - he extends purse toward her.) Look - (She looks away) Look - (She darts a glance.) Please look at this purse - (She nervously looks.) What do you see? What? What do you see in your purse? (Sylvia mumbles.) What? (Sylvia mumbles again.) Speak out - let me hear you -
SYLVIA. Oatmeal - oatmeal! All right?
HARVEY. Oatmeal.
SYLVIA. Yes - are you happy now? Are you satisfied - you sadistic son-of-a-bitch - oatmeal -
HARVEY. Cooked oatmeal.
SYLVIA. Yes - cooked oatmeal - cold cooked oatmeal - you are vicious - you knew there was oatmeal in that purse - you know it.
HARVEY. I want you to know it. I want you to see it.
SYLVIA. I see it - I see it.
HARVEY. Now - Why? - Why - is your purse filled - filled to the brim with old cold wet cooked oatmeal.
SYLVIA. I see it's filled with oatmeal.
HARVEY. Why?
SYLVIA. Oh Harvey - I -
HARVEY. (Gently.) Why, Sylvia, why?
SYLVIA. I don't know.
HARVEY. Do you want a purse full of oatmeal?
SYLVIA. No -
HARVEY. Does any woman want a purse full of cooked oatmeal? Do anybody need that?
SYLVIA. No -
HARVEY. Do you need it?
SYLVIA. No - I don't think so.
HARVEY. You don't think so?
SYLVIA. No - I know - I don't need it.
HARVEY. Then why is it there, Sylvia?
SYLVIA. I - don't know.
HARVEY. It's there because you put it there.
SYLVIA. I'm so embarrassed.
HARVEY. All right - so you put it there - didn't you.
SYLVIA. I suppose so - yes.
HARVEY. And you got it where?
SYLVIA. Please, you've made your point - I can't -
HARVEY. Where did you get the oatmeal? Did you cook it this morning at home? Did you cook it and then pour it into your purse?
SYLVIA. No.
HARVEY. Did you buy it?
SYLVIA. Buy it?
HARVEY. Then you found it - somewhere.
SYLVIA. Stouffers.
HARVEY. Stouffers - You went into Stouffers for breakfast and you -
SYLVIA. For coffee.
HARVEY. And you saw a bowl of oatmeal on the next table and reached -
SYLVIA. On the same table - (Pause.) on the table where I sat down. They hadn't cleared the table yet.
HARVEY. You sat down at a dirty table.
SYLVIA. It was crowded - they were busy.
HARVEY. And you emptied it out of the bowl into your purse.
SYLVIA. I didn't empty it - I put it in my purse - all of it.
HARVEY. The bowl too. - (He pokes two fingers into purse and half-pulls out oatmeal bowl - he pushes it back down and snaps purse shut.) Sylvia - What does this make you?
SYLVIA. The oatmeal?
HARVEY. The oatmeal and the hubcap and the ketchup bottle and the chicken bones. Chicken bones, Sylvia. You're an intelligent woman - what does this - (Lifts purse.) make you?
SYLVIA. A - bag - lady? I don't want to turn into a bag lady, Harvey - I don't want to push a supermarket cart down the street talking to myself and screaming at everybody - I don't want to sleep in a doorway -
HARVEY. You'll never sleep in a doorway -
SYLVIA. This is how it starts - the oatmeal - and shopping bags - then talking to myself, then screaming at people on the street and rummaging through garbage cans and begging for money and not bathing and weaving things into my hair and growing a moustache and drinking wine and sleeping in doorways and getting arrested - oh my God, Harvey, don't let them arrest me - don't let me sleep in the doorway, please, Harvey - please -
HARVEY. Don't get hysterical -
SYLVIA. And if I start weaving that crazy stuff into my hair you've got to stop me - slap me -
HARVEY. I could never slap -
SYLVIA. You've got to - you must - Try it - do it now. Slap me.
HARVEY. Sylvia, I can't just slap -
SYLVIA. Slap me and I'll leave this whole bag right where it is - bring me to my senses and we can go home -
HARVEY. Sylvia -
SYLVIA. You've got to be forceful, Harvey. They have no homes - they prowl the streets - they don't get their hair done - they don't have to bathe - they don't have to shave their legs - they don't worry about it - No cooking to do - no house to clean - No man to - consider. They scream out "Hey buster, watch your fender - you son-of-a-bitch - Watch out, you rotten creep - Fuck you, pompous self - righteous - Kiss - me." Ow! (Slap.) Thank you, Harvey - I'm leaving that bag right there - We can go home. I'm all right now!
HARVEY. I just wanted you to be aware of -
SYLVIA. I'm grateful - you saved me, I'm lucky to have you, Harvey. I'm going to take this sandwich home for later -
HARVEY. Sylvia -
SYLVIA. That's all right - I don't need it. Wait a minute - what if they see we're leaving the bag - what if the waitress sees - and shouts - "Hey lady, you're forgetting your bag" - I'd die of embarrassment, Harvey, I'll tell you what - I'll take it outside and we can dump it in the nearest trash basket - Now, I know there's a large basket over on Third Avenue and Fifty-Seventh - oh, wait there's a better one on Fifty-Ninth Street - we can just - (She continues to talk as they exit and the curtain falls.)
